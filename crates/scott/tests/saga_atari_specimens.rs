//! Picture family C on the **Atari 8-bit** companion picture sides (§8.3,
//! §7.3, §12.10 — SQ-1483, SQ-1484).
//!
//! # What these disks are
//!
//! Seven two-sided US S.A.G.A. releases, catalogued in §10.5 with the sha256
//! of every file. Side A is the database side (§12.12 tabulates what each one
//! decodes to) and side B is nothing but artwork: **no Atari DOS 2 directory**
//! — the eight sectors where one would be hold picture data like every other
//! sector — so §8.3's "on the Atari there is no filesystem walk" is right, and
//! a reader has only the bytes.
//!
//! ```text
//! <fixtures>/atari/SAGA #4 - Voodoo Castle [side B].atr        sha256 2a417fb62f14…
//! <fixtures>/atari/SAGA #5 - The Count [side B].atr            sha256 37fd7e4fd1cf…

//!                                                              sha256 9542de4bb9d8…
//! ```
//!
//! where `<fixtures>` is `$SCOTT_DIALECT_FIXTURES` or `stories/scott-dialects`.
//! Commercial game files, not redistributable, not committed — every case here
//! **skips vacuously with an explanation** when a disk is absent, because a
//! silent skip reads exactly like a pass.
//!
//! # Only three of the seven are family C
//!
//! The other four — *Adventureland*, *Pirate Adventure*, *Mission Impossible*
//! and *Strange Odyssey* — keep a line-drawing token stream on side B instead,
//! the format Appendix A item 26 measured on the four **plain** Apple II
//! releases. [`no_line_art_side_is_mistaken_for_a_bitmap_side`] is the case
//! that says so, and it is as much a part of this suite as the three that
//! decode: a scanner that found "records" on those four would be finding noise.
//!
//! # What settles the record shape
//!
//! No oracle, unlike [`saga_pictures_specimens`](../saga_pictures_specimens),
//! whose MS-DOS twin decided §8.3's inclusive limit. What settles it here is
//! that a family-C record is **self-proving**: its header says how many byte
//! pairs it holds, and a wrong reading of the header — a twelve-byte one, the
//! other compression scheme, the other edge convention — cannot produce
//! exactly that many. See `scott::saga_atari` for the shape and for how far
//! it departs from §8.3's prose.

// ── The line-art sides' own picture table (SQ-1524, investigation findings) ──
//
// The four `AtariPictureFormat::LineArt` titles carry their (usage, index)
// table ON SIDE B — not on side A, where the three bitmap titles keep theirs
// (SQ-1496): side A of these four holds no `[adv, adv, adv]` marker anywhere
// near 0x9590, and side B holds one at 0x290, right where the bitmap sides
// carry the same three bytes in front of their first record. The table has
// the bitmap table's shape — 100 room-usage slots then object slots, two
// bytes `[A, S]` each, all-zero for "no picture" — but NOT its arithmetic:
// the byte within the sector is `(A >> 2) * 3`, because a line-art record is
// laid on a three-byte grid (its tokens are three bytes each), where a bitmap
// record is laid on a seven-byte one. There is no inventory flag bit, because
// an object picture serves both uses — exactly as the same four titles'
// Apple II `B<aa><nnn>` files do, one file per object, no R/I suffix.
//
// What settles the arithmetic is the walk below: every entry lands on a
// record whose three-byte tokens all keep to the 160 x 96 GRAPHICS 7 canvas,
// whose `0x00` end byte falls 0-2 zero bytes before the next entry's own
// offset, and whose picture is what the index says it is (entry 0 spells
// `IT'S TOO DARK!`, 99 the Adventure International globe, 98 `INVENTORY`,
// Adventureland's 24 a devil in flames for "...Oh Hell!"). Read the same
// entries with the bitmap arithmetic and most land mid-stream.
//
// Note what this ALSO says about the earlier `decode_line_art_opening`
// reading (retired, SQ-1525): the tokens here are on a 160 x 96 canvas with
// fixed three-byte width, not the Apple's 280 x 192 mixed-width grammar, so
// that function's decode was a misreading — see the SQ-1524 investigation
// note.
//
// The table's own layout (the marker offset, the table offset, the entry
// count) and the arithmetic that turns a two-byte entry into a side-B FILE
// offset are now production code — promoted from this suite's own hand-rolled
// copies once SQ-1524/SQ-1525's implementation lane wired the table into
// `PictSource`, the same way [`table_entry_file_offset`] was for the bitmap
// titles above — so this suite calls `scott::saga_atari`'s versions rather
// than maintaining a second copy that could drift from them.
