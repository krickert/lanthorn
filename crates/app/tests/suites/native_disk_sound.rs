//! Sounds a release disk carries natively, checked against a rendition of the same
//! sounds that somebody else made (SQ-0907).
//!
//! Two Infocom games use sound: *The Lurking Horror* and *Sherlock*. On the Amiga
//! their disks hold a `Sound/` directory — an `sN.nam` index per Z-machine effect,
//! naming a sample and a pitch file — and the samples are an Infocom container that
//! nothing else reads. The Macintosh compilation lays the same sounds out as
//! `/MAC/SOUND`, with the pitch inlined into the index.

//! **A format worked out from bytes alone is a guess.** `stories/Lurking.blb` and
//! `stories/Sherlock.blb` are these same effects wrapped as Blorb `Snd ` resources in
//! AIFF, by a third party, and they are what turn this from reverse-engineering into
//! verification: the frames must be byte-identical, and — since SQ-0923 read the pitch
//! model out of the Amiga interpreter rather than guessing it from the corpus — the
//! rates must agree too, which they do on 27 of the 29 effects the two Blorbs carry.
//! That pair of checks is the whole point of the suite and is why the decoder is

/// `/MAC/SOUND` on *Lost Treasures* disc 2 carries bare `S<n>` samples in the same
/// container, and an `M<n>` only for the four effects whose pitch is not the sample's
/// own: 8, 11, 13 and 14 — exactly the four whose Amiga `.mid` does not read 74.
/// `M<n>` is the eleven-byte pitch blob with the index appended, so one file does the
/// work of the Amiga's `.mid` and `.nam` together.
///
/// Effect 12 has no `M12`, so `S12` is effect 12 in its own right; `M11` and `M13`
/// both redirect to that same `S12`. Nothing but the index says so — which is the
/// same lesson `sherlocks_effects_come_from_the_index_not_from_filenames` teaches on
/// the Amiga, in a layout where it is even easier to get wrong.
///
/// The rates are asserted against the disc's own headers bent by the disc's own
/// notes, never against `stories/Sherlock.blb`, which follows a different model — see
