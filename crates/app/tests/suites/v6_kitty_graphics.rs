//! The kitty pixel path, exercised headlessly — SQ-0590.
//!
//! Every other v6 render test builds `Picker::halfblocks()`, which reports a 10×20
//! cell and draws ordinary glyphs. That never reaches `render_kitty_virtual` or the
//! chrome-band cache, so uploads, re-uploads, evictions and placements — the machinery
//! every v6 graphics regression this cycle lived in — had no coverage at all, and the
//! only way to find a fault in it was to play the game and look.
//!
//! The protocol traffic is invisible in the rendered `Buffer` (under kitty the cells
//! carry placeholder glyphs, not pixels), so these tests assert on the op log
//! `GraphicsRender` records as it works: what was uploaded, what was merely re-placed,
//! what was dropped, and what ended up on screen.
