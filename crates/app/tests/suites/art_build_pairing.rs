//! SQ-0866: **artwork from a different build is not drawn into a disk-mounted
//! story** — and the far larger set of pairings that must survive the rule.
//!
//! # The report
//!
//! > "the graphics on 'Arthur Quest 4 Excalibur.2mg' are corrupted once the game
//! > starts. looks like some of the indexes might be corrupted?"
//!
//! and, when a neighbouring loose file was guessed at:
//!
//! > "no, i'm using the default and loading from the 2gs image"
//!
//! # What was measured
//!
//! The reassembly is sound (SQ-0852's packed-volume reader verifies that story
//! against its own header checksum, `$45EB`, and it boots and plays) and the
//! archive on the volume was not misparsed — `MountedDisk::pictures()` offered
//! *nothing* for that image, because `InfocomPics::parse` rejected all five
//! `ARTHUR.D*` segments and every other file on it. (SQ-0863 has since read
//! them: the archives are INSIDE the segments, in an Apple flavour with 8-byte
//! directory records, and the disk now draws its own 168 pictures. The rule
//! below is unchanged by that and the cases say so.) So tier 1 ran, and
//! `blorb::resolve_resource_blorb`'s directory scan matched `Arthur.blb` on a
//! six-character stem prefix:
//!
//! | | release | serial | pictures |
//! | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `Arthur Quest 4 Excalibur.2mg` (Apple IIgs) | 63 | 890622 | 168 |
//! | `Arthur.blb` (DOS press) | 74 | 890714 | **326** |
//!
//! The game asked for its own picture numbers and got another build's.
//!
//! # The rule this suite pins
//!
//! `app::graphics::resource_blorb`. A Blorb is refused when it **contradicts**
//! the story — it carries the Blorb spec's optional `IFhd` Game Identifier, the
//! story came off a disk image, and that identifier matches no build on the
//! release. Everything else keeps its artwork, and the cases below are chosen to
//! be the ones that would break first if the rule were widened:
//!
//! - a Blorb that states no build (most of the corpus) — [`a_blorb_that_states_no_build_is_never_refused`]
//! - a loose story whose Blorb states a DIFFERENT build on purpose (FMV Poker) —
//!   [`fmvpoker_keeps_the_plates_its_readme_tells_the_player_to_borrow`]
//! - a disk that supplies its own art — [`a_disk_with_its_own_artwork_is_never_asked_about_a_blorb`]
//! - the whole corpus — [`no_medium_in_the_corpus_loses_artwork_except_the_mismatched_one`]
//!
//! `stories/` is gitignored (commercial media), so every case skips vacuously
//! when its fixture is missing and every `ran > 0` guard is gated on a
//! presence check — CI has none of this on any platform and must not fail on its
//! absence.
