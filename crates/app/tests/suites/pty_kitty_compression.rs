//! `o=z` on the wire, and the app's own report of it, checked against each other
//! (SQ-0993).
//!
//! SQ-0991 shipped kitty transmission compression on a hand-run pty capture. No
//! suite pinned it, and **its failure mode is silent in both directions**: a
//! terminal that cannot inflate a transmit simply draws nothing (the image is
//! never stored, and every placement naming it disappears — measured, when `o=z`
//! first met the oracle's codec-free terminal core), and the capability quietly
//! reverting to raw looks like nothing at all. Both were live risks: SQ-0992 found
//! that a mid-session font change rebuilt the picker with an EMPTY capability list
//! and dropped compression back to raw until relaunch, and nothing noticed.
//!
//! **The two halves are asserted against EACH OTHER, and that is the real test.**
//! One case reads the wire; the other reads what `/dump-terminal` says about the
//! wire; and the third fails if they disagree. Either alone can be right about
//! nothing — a report that reads its own wish, a wire nobody can explain — and a
//! disagreement between them is a defect neither could catch.
//!
//! `/dump-terminal` is read from its LOG rather than off the screen, which is what
//! the log is for: a v6 pane is drawn out of kitty placeholder glyphs, so the
//! transcript copy of the report is exactly the thing that cannot be read back.
//!
//! Unix only; a pty is. Windows gets an explicit skip.
