//! SQ-0850: the per-game save directory, measured on the real corpus.
//!
//! One image held one game for as long as `stories/` held only single-title
//! floppies, and keying a game's saves on the image's *filename* was safe by
//! accident. It is not any more: `Infocom Compilation 1 (19xx)(-).st` carries
//! six games, `floppy2.ima` carries six more, and every one of them resolved to
//! the same `<image>.save/` — one `default.lanthorn` for six stories, each
//! overwriting the last.
//!
//! The rule now has two halves ([`cli_host::storage`]): a **loose** story file
//! keys on its basename exactly as before, and a story **mounted out of a disk
//! image** keys on its own release and serial. The unit tests beside the rule
//! pin its arithmetic; this file pins it against the media, which is the only
//! place the interesting cases actually exist — the same build pressed onto
//! three different disks, three different builds of one game, and thirty-odd
//! stories that must land in thirty-odd directories.
//!
//! `stories/` is gitignored (commercial media), so every case here skips
//! vacuously when its fixture is missing; the `ran > 0` guards that catch a
//! locally drifted filename are gated on [`any_media_present`] so they cannot
//! fire on CI, which legitimately has none of it.
