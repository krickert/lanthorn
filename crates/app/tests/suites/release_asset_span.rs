//! SQ-0862: **a story's assets span the release, not the platter** — measured on
//! the two DOS presses of Zork Zero and on every set in the corpus that must not
//! be widened.
//!
//! # The report
//!
//! > "with the zork0 dos disk images I'm not seeing all of the artwork options in
//! > the story list. and when `… (360K) (Disk 2) …ima` starts, no artwork is used
//! > so the story doesn't display any."
//!
//! Both halves are one defect. The DOS press splits the story from its artwork
//! across disks, and asset discovery mounted only the image the story came off:
//!
//! | volume | holds |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | 360K Disk 1 | `INSTALL.EXE`, `ZORK0.CG1`, `EZR.EXE`, `IZORK0.RUN` |
//! | 360K Disk 2 | `ZORK0.ZIP`, `ZORKZERO.EXE` — **the story, and no artwork at all** |
//! | 360K Disk 3 | `ZORK0.EG1` |
//! | 720K Disk 1 | the story, `ZORK0.MG1`, and the DOS launchers |
//! | 720K Disk 2 | `ZORK0.CG1` |
//!
//! So booting the 360K story disk found nothing to draw with and offered nothing
//! to pick, and the 720K story disk found its own MCGA and missed the CGA next to
//! it. `app::assets::volumes` is the fix, and the interesting half of it is what
//! it refuses — see `a_multi_game_compilation_shares_no_artwork` below.
//!
//! `stories/` is gitignored (commercial media), so every case skips vacuously
//! when its fixture is missing and every `ran > 0` guard is gated on
//! [`any_media_present`] — CI has none of this on any platform and must not fail
//! on its absence.
