//! SQ-0942: the committed gallery recipe stays loadable, and stays honest.
//!
//! `examples/gallery.toml` is the only committed half of the gallery — the PNGs
//! are output and live under `target/`. That makes this file the thing that can
//! go stale silently: nobody runs the gallery except at release time, and a
//! manifest that no longer parses, or that has grown a duplicate id, or that
//! quietly sets an argument the tool owns, would be discovered by whoever is
//! trying to cut a release. These cases move that discovery to the gate.
//!
//! Everything here is about the RECIPE. No case boots a story or wants a
//! gitignored medium, so the whole suite runs in CI exactly as it runs locally.
//! What the frames LOOK like is not testable and is not tested; that is the
//! user's eye and the proof sheet's job.
