//! Input → `Action` mapping and application.
//!
//! # Focus routing
//! `key_to_action` applies bindings in this strict precedence order:
//! 1. Ctrl+Q / Ctrl+C → Quit (always wins, even during a prompt).
//! 2. Prompt active → route to prompt only; all other keys absorbed as None.
//! 3. Tidy-anim sub-mode → KeyMap lookup in Anim context; no fallthrough.
//! 4. Gallery sub-mode → gallery_key_to_action.
//! 5. Saves-manager sub-mode → saves_key_to_action.
//! 6. Hotkey dialog open → hotkey_dialog_key_to_action.
//! 7. Key == hotkeys.prefix → OpenHotkeyDialog.
//! 8. Tab (no modifiers) → autocomplete-or-ToggleFocus special case.
//! 9. Ctrl modifier → Global KeyMap lookup, filtered by hotkeys.is_direct.
//! 10. Per-focus routing:
//!     - Game: game_key_to_action, then Global fallthrough.
//!     - Map: Map context lookup, filtered by hotkeys.is_direct (direct commands only).
//!
//! The former bottom-bar text-entry prompts are now the `text_entry` /
//! `confirm_delete_save` modals, whose key/mouse input the run-loop intercepts in
//! `main.rs` own directly (like the save-name dialog). This module only OPENS them
//! and provides `apply_text_entry` for the submit. (SQ-0307)
//!
//! # Caller-handled actions
//! `apply_action` handles view/light-correction actions in-process.  The
//! following actions are LEFT FOR THE CALLER (the run loop) to handle and are
//! silently ignored by `apply_action`:
//!   - `SubmitCommand` — caller sends text to the Z-machine.
//!   - `SaveGame` / `RestoreGame` — caller performs I/O.
//!   - `ExportSvg` — caller writes file.
//!   - `Quit` — caller exits the event loop.
