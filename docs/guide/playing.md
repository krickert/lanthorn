# Playing

For anyone with a story open who wants to know what lanthorn adds on top of
typing commands.

## Typing, and what fills in around it

The prompt is the story's own — type a command and press `Enter`, exactly as
in any interpreter. What lanthorn adds sits *around* that line and never
steals it: **Tab** completes from the things actually in front of you first
(standing in the Living Room, `lan` offers `lantern`), then words the story
has just used, then its whole dictionary — checked against the story's own
parser, so you're never offered a word it would refuse. The rest of the
match ghosts in dim text right after the caret; `Tab`/`Shift-Tab` cycle
candidates, `→` at the end of the line takes the one on offer — and so does a
click anywhere in the story pane, if you'd rather reach for the mouse.

Type `/` on an empty line and a fuzzy palette opens over every command
lanthorn knows — the fastest way to find out what's there without
memorizing anything. `↑`/`↓` at the prompt recall earlier commands,
shell-style. See [keys](../reference/keys.md) and
[commands](../reference/commands.md) for the full lists.

## The command panel

Press the `▲` control on the story pane's bottom border (or
`/open-command-band`) and a dock opens along the bottom that builds a command
by pointing instead of typing. It reads the running story's own grammar — every verb it
actually accepts, alphabetically — and fills in object columns for what
you can see and what you're carrying, live, as you play. Click a verb, then
an object, and the words land on your prompt; **Enter** still sends
whatever's actually written there, so nothing fires on its own except the
one-click quick actions.

Those quick actions draw as a compass rose when the band is wide enough, with
the map's own portal glyphs — `↑` `◉` `◎` `↓` for up, in, out and down —
clustered beside it. Each is a single click that submits at once, no `Enter`
needed. Typing always wins over the band: letters and Backspace go straight
to the prompt whether the band is open or not, and the band only claims
column navigation (`Tab`/`Shift-Tab` to move between columns, `↑`/`↓` to
highlight a row).

The same bottom border cycles through to an inventory panel — a plain strip
of what you're carrying — and an item there clicks onto the prompt exactly
the way a command panel object does.

## The word reveal

Press the `◈` control (or `/reveal-words`) and every word already on screen
that this story's parser would accept lights up for a few seconds, right
over the prose, without moving a line of it. It's the answer to the oldest
frustration in the genre — a room description names a dozen things and the
game only implements two — and it's telling you what the *dictionary*
knows, not a promise that any of it is within reach.

The command panel carries the same idea as a running list: under what's
actually here, dimmed, sit the nouns the story has *printed* this session —
things a room describes rather than things it hands you directly. Newest
first, and it keeps accumulating, so something named forty turns ago is
still one click away.

## Reading back

**Left-drag** across the story pane selects transcript text; let go and it
lands on your system clipboard, even over SSH — lanthorn copies through the
terminal's own OSC 52 escape rather than a clipboard library, so it works
wherever your terminal does. In an illustrated v6 game the two gestures share
the pane and never collide: a plain click goes to the game — Zork Zero's
banner compass, a hint topic — while a drag selects text, exactly as it does
anywhere else.

`/search-transcript <query>` highlights every match and jumps to the most
recent; `n`/`N` step through the rest. `/filter-transcript` narrows the view
to just the game's own output, just lanthorn's, or both. `/export-transcript`
writes what's on screen out to a text file in the story's own save
directory.

### Recall something you have seen

Use `/recall what can light a dark room` to search your playthrough by meaning
as well as words. Exact names still matter: `/recall brass lantern` combines
keyword ranking with sentence similarity. A panel shows the original passage;
`n` selects the next ranked result, `N` the previous one, and arrows or
PageUp/PageDown scroll the full excerpt. `Esc` closes the panel and leaves the
transcript positioned at the source paragraph. A bare
`/recall` repeats your last recall query. No command is sent to the game and no
turn is spent.

Recall searches the story text and player commands in the current transcript
view. It excludes lanthorn's messages, assistance output, hidden game data and
external walkthroughs. Command context is included when the transcript records
it; unusual game prompts remain searchable as original text. Failed actions
retain the game's refusal. Results are evidence of what happened, not
instructions about what to do next.
Restoring or restarting invalidates results, and a new search uses the restored
transcript. It does not retain a separate history of abandoned timelines.

The Docker image includes the pinned **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** model and loads it
locally, including when the container has no network access. For native installs,
the first query downloads the model (about 91 MB)
from Hugging Face into `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/lanthorn/recall/` or
`~/.cache/lanthorn/recall/` (`%LOCALAPPDATA%/lanthorn/recall/` on Windows).
Model loading and search run in the background. Later searches use the cached
model; the transcript and query stay on your machine. The vectors and keyword
index are kept in memory for this session. A 384-component float vector uses
1,536 bytes, so 10,000 vectors use about 15 MB, plus text/index storage and the
model's own memory.

For offline setup, set `LANTHORN_RECALL_MODEL_DIR` to a directory containing
`config.json`, `tokenizer.json`, and `model.safetensors` from model revision
`1110a243fdf4706b3f48f1d95db1a4f5529b4d41`. Files are checked against pinned
SHA-256 digests. An explicit directory never downloads replacements. If the
model cannot load, recall reports **keyword-only** results and explains why;
it does not present that fallback as semantic search.

Similarity is a ranking aid, not proof that a passage answers a question.
Read the returned game text in context. The initial model is intended for
English; lexical matching still helps with exact names in other languages.
Indirect references can be missed: in Mini-Zork, "what was written on the
paper" does not reliably find the leaflet text. Including the observed name,
such as `leaflet`, helps. Recall does not generate an answer when it finds a
similar passage; it shows the original text for you to judge.

When a turn prints more than fits the pane — a long room description, a
hint page — lanthorn stops at the first full screen with a `[MORE]` bar
instead of scrolling straight past it, exactly like the original Infocom
interpreters. Any key pages onward, and nothing reaches the game until
you've caught up.

## Keeping a transcript

Many games have a `SCRIPT` command (`TRANSCRIPT` in some, `UNSCRIPT` or
`NOSCRIPT` to stop). Type it and the story starts writing everything it
prints — and everything you type — to `script.txt` in the game's own
folder, alongside its saves. It's plain text: read it, mail it, diff two
playthroughs, paste a puzzle into a hint request.

Plenty of games offer no such command. `/set-transcript on` throws the same
switch from lanthorn's side, and tells you which file it landed in;
`/set-transcript off` stops it. Turning it on again later adds to the same
file rather than starting over, so a game played across a week is one
document.

That's the *story's* transcript, and it's a different thing from
`/export-transcript`, which writes out the scrollback in front of you —
lanthorn's own lines and images included.

And there's a third option, for following along rather than looking back:
launch with `--transcript-file <path>` and lanthorn appends every line — the
game's, your own typed commands, lanthorn's own warnings — to that file
live, as it happens. It's built for accessibility tooling: point a screen
reader or a second terminal's `tail -f` at the file and it reads each turn
the moment it lands, engine-neutral across the Z-machine, Glulx and Scott
Adams games alike (unlike `/set-transcript`, which is the Z-machine's own
`SCRIPT` stream and only ever carries what the game itself chose to write).

Games can also record the commands you type, to `commands.txt` in the same
folder, and play a recorded file back in place of the keyboard. It's the
format other interpreters use, so a script recorded elsewhere replays here.

## Hints

`/open-hints` lays a companion *InvisiClues* file over the story pane — its
own topic menu on top, the clue text below, driven with the arrow keys and
whatever it prompts for. lanthorn finds a hint file sitting beside the
story automatically, or you can fetch one for free from the story picker
before you even start playing (see [Getting started](getting-started.md)).
